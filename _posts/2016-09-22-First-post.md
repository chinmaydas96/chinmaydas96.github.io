*Here we are!*

OK, first of all: some explanation.
Let's be didactic and go with the [Five Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws):

- What happens?

> It happens that I begin a personal tech blog.

- Who do this?

> [This](/alessandro-borsoi) shady character.

- When do it take place?

> Whenever there will be time and will.

- Where do it take place?

> In this very blog.

- Why do this happen?

> The main reason is to have an instrument to support the study during my second degree in computer science.
Try to explain to others something is for sure a good method to gain a better understanding of a topic.

The arguments will be related to low level programming, algorithms and data structures. A lot of C will be involved.
But, hey, everything that deserves attention can stay here.

Stay tuned.
