My name is Alessandro Borsoi, a really passionate software developer. 
Currently I am working as Java consultant in a big insurance company.
 
While I do this job from almost five years, ranging over different technologies and projects, I have a quite 
different background: my first degree was in aerospace engineering. I am luckily landing to the world of ones and 
zeros in 2011 and was love at first sigh. In 2015 I decided to have a better understanding of the matter and I 
started a second degree in computer science together with the full time job.


The purpose of this blog is to help me to deepen some of the stuff I'm studying and like the most.
